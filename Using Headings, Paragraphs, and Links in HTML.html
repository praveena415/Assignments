    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Heading Number 2</h2>
    <p>H2 tags are used to divide the main content into sections, providing a clear hierarchy and allowing users to navigate through the page easily. In blog posts or articles, H2 tags are often used to display the main title of each section or subsection, making it visually distinct and facilitating content consumption.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Heading Number 3</h3>
    <p>The H3 tag in HTML is used to represent a third-level heading within a document, indicating a subsection or subtopic. It's used to organize content further, following H1 (main heading) and H2 (subheading). This helps improve page structure, readability, and accessibility. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Heading Number 4</h4>
    <p>In HTML, the H4 tag is used for subheadings of a lower level of importance than H3, H2, and H1. It's part of the HTML heading structure, helping to organize content and improve readability. </p>
